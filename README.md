# SPA
Designing a single page application

-- Description

A SPA is a web application that literally has one page â€” a single HTML page is loaded in the browser and is not reloaded during use. When users interact with the page, the application dynamically rewrites/updates the current page rather than loading a new page from the server. Since the HTML is rendered and manipulated client-side, the size of the payload is decreased because the server returns only JSON, not HTML. Many popular JavaScript frameworks, including Vue.js, AngularJS, Ember.js, Meteor.js, and React, have adopted SPA principles.
